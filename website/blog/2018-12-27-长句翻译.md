### 1 that用法

- that有很多用法:
> 1 that作限定词代词   
> 2 that作副词表示程度,相当于so   
> 3 that作连接,引导各类从句  
> 4 that用在强调句型中

- that作代词

```
For example, you might decide that for an API style decision, the elements of research and choice generation should be owned by a centralized, strategic API management team, while the elements of choice selection, authorization, and implementation are owned by the API teams themselves. 

如:你可以为API样式决策做出下面的决定:研究和生成选项元素归属于中心化的,战略上的API管理团队,而选择,授权和实现元素归属于做出它们的团队.
```
> 解析:这里that是代词,代替第一个逗号之后的所有内容.

- that引导定语从句

```
that the API is a product fully deserving of proper design thinking, prototyping, customer research, and testing, as well as long-term monitoring and maintenance. 

API是一个产品,它完全值得进行适当的设计思维,原型设计,客户研究和测试,以及长期监测和维护.
```
> 解析:that指代the API is a product这个句子,这么翻译就没有谓语了,所以这个句子存在省略成分,应在the API is a product之后增加which is,即句子变成:that the API is a product (which is) fully deserving of proper...;that引导定语从句,which is是主句.


### 句型整理

Developer experience for managing the post-release lifecycle of your product and to gain insights for future modifications.
